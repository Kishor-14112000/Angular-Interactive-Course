# Angular-Interactive-Course
During my time at iamneo, I successfully completed a real-time project involving the development of an Angular Interactive Course page. This project utilized Angular and TypeScript for the frontend, Express.js for the backend, and MySQL for the database. Currently, I am working on another real-time project.
